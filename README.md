## RecoFACE 
## Introduction
RecoFACE is a Face Recognition Application made in python using OpenCV.

It uses OpenCV for capturing and handling the images.
It uses OpenCV Haar-Cascade Classifier to search for faces in the entire image.
It uses OpenCV Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) LBPHFaceRecognizer model for feature extraction and learns from them.
The learnt model is then saved in a yml file.
LBPHFaceRecognizer is also used for the detection of the learnt faces.
